###Instructions for project 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The project requires to submit:   
1 A tidy data set as described below  
2 A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis  
3 A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md  
4 A README.md in the repo with scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.   

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
